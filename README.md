# interactive-bezier-assignment
Implement an interactive cubic Bézier curve that behaves like a rope reacting to motion input. This project tests your understanding of math, graphics programming, and real-time input handling
Interactive Bézier Curve with Physics & Sensor Control Description
This project implements an interactive cubic Bézier curve that behaves like a springy rope. The curve reacts in real time to mouse movement and updates smoothly using a spring-damping physics model.
All Bézier math, tangent calculation, and physics logic are implemented manually from scratch, without using any external libraries.

How to Run (VS Code)
 Open the project folder in VS Code
 Open index.html
 Right-click inside the file and select "Open with Live Server" (or simply open the file in a browser)
Move the mouse to interact with the Bézier curve
